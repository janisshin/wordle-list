# wordle-list-generator

*Currently under progress* 

**How to use:**

This will only work on Mac or Linux. If you are a Windows user, go to the Windows Store and download the Ubuntu app. 
1. Open the terminal (or the Ubuntu app for Windows users).
2. Copy and past the following:
`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/project/branch/path/file.sh)`
3. Follow the prompts!

The goal is to make it run without the use of an IDE, because not everyone who plays Wordle is a coder.
